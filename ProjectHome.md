Abstract

Nowadays a huge volume of data (e.g. images) are daily generated
in several areas. The importance of this subject has led to a new
paradigm known as eScience. In this scenario, the biological image domain
emerges as an important research area given the great impact that
it can leads in real solutions and people's lives. On the other hand, to
cope with this massive data it is necessary to integrate into the same
environment not only several techniques involving image processing, description
and classication, but also feature selection methods. Hence, in
the present paper we propose a new framework capable to join these techniques
in a single and ecient pipeline, in order to characterize biological
images. Experiments, performed with the ImageCLEF dataset, have
shown that the proposed framework presented notable results, reaching
up to 87% of accuracy regarding the plant species classication, which
is a highly relevant and non-trivial task.
